Additionally, I co-founded R-Ladies Colombo a local chapter of the R-Ladies Global Organization which aims to promote gender diversity in the R programming community.\nMy research revolves around Computational Statistics, Anomaly Detection, Time series analysis and forecasting and Statistical Machine Learning. I’m passionate about developing innovative methods and tools to analyze complex data. I am also strongly committed to developing open-source software tools to facilitate reproducible research. You can check out some of my projects here: Visit me on Twitter I post mostly about R, Python, statistics, data science, and science in nature.\nFrom 2021 to 2024, I served as an associate editor for The R Journal. I’ve also contributed as an Associate Investigator at the Australian Research Council’s (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS) from 2019 to 2021.\nThiyanga Talagala,PhD in Statistics, Monash University, Australia is my sister."
