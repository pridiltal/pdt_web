If you're building a website with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and want to showcase your projects in a clean, responsive grid layout, you're in the right place. In this blog post, I‚Äôll show you how to create a **project page with blocks**, each containing a title, description, image, and link to a detailed project page.

## üìÅ Step 1: Organize Your Project Structure

Let‚Äôs assume the following structure for your Quarto website:

```         
project.qmd
projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.qmd
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project2.qmd
images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project2.png
```

-   `project.qmd` is your main **project listing page**.
-   `projects/` contains detailed `.qmd` files for each project.
-   `images/` contains thumbnails or preview images for each project.

## üß± Step 2: Add a Grid of Project Blocks

Inside `project.qmd`, we‚Äôll use Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system (which Quarto supports) to create a responsive layout.

``` markdown
---
title: "My Projects"
format: html
page-layout: full
toc: false
---

# üöÄ My Projects

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
![Anomaly Detection](images/project1.png){width=100px style="float:left; margin-right:1em;"}

### Anomaly Detection in Image Streams  
**Description**: A real-time system for identifying anomalies in high-dimensional image data using explainable AI techniques.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, XAI, TensorFlow

:::

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
![Outbreak Detection](images/project2.png){width=100px style="float:left; margin-right:1em;"}

### Outbreak Detection from Surveillance Data  
**Description**: A forecasting tool for detecting early warning signals of disease outbreaks using time series and anomaly detection models.  
**Tech Stack**: R, Prophet, Anomalize

:::
```

### üîç Explanation

-   `.grid` starts a responsive row of blocks.
-   `.g-col-md-6` means: take half the width on medium and larger screens.
-   `.g-col-12` ensures blocks stack vertically on small screens (Full-width column (single column)).
-    If you want three columns, for example, you could use {.g-col-4} (4 + 4 + 4 = 12), and so on.
-    The number 12 comes from the Bootstrap grid system, which Quarto uses under the hood for layout.
-   `![Project Image](...)` adds a project thumbnail with a nice float layout.

## üìù Step 3: Create Individual Project Pages

Each `projects/projectX.qmd` file is a standard Quarto page:

``` markdown
---
title: "Project One"
format: html
---

# Anomaly Detection in Image Streams

This project presents a real-time anomaly detection system for high-dimensional image streams, designed to identify unexpected or suspicious patterns. We leverage explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions and highlight regions of interest in images.


Include any plots, images, or code relevant to this project.
```

These pages will render as part of your site, with their own URL.


## ‚úÖ Result

You now have a responsive, visually clean **project gallery** page, where each block links to a separate project detail page ‚Äî perfect for portfolios, research showcases, or teaching materials.
